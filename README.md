Socio-demographic and Clinical Predictors of Medication Adherence Among Psychiatric Outpatients in Mozambique: A Two-Year Longitudinal Survival Analysis
This repository contains the code used in our study, which examines the socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with medication adherence among psychiatric outpatients in Mozambique over a two-year period. Below is an overview of the code structure:

Part 1: Data Management and Cleaning
This section includes code for importing, managing, and cleaning the dataset to prepare it for analysis.

Part 2: Survival Analysis
This part of the code conducts survival analysis, including the Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, and diagnostic testing for model assumptions.

Part 3: Linear Mixed Model
The final section runs the linear mixed model to analyze longitudinal trends in adherence over time.
